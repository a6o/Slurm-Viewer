Ver. 1.0.1

Navigate:  
You need to use terminal and shell prompt that allows mouse movement. Current tool does not work with keyboard only.
Click on the any row of the left panel to see specific jobs on the right. 

Keys:
- D: Toggle dark mode on and off
- R: Refresh. This tool does not show in real-time! You need to refresh manually.
- S: Take a screenshot, and save to your home directory.
- N: Fetch all the unknown names. This does not work in Neuronic. You might want to copy your saved settings from Ionic to Neuronic manually.
- O,P: Move between partitions
- ?: How-to Screen. (This screen)
- Q: Quit.



Settings are saved in ~/.jihoon. We currently store:  
- Last visited partition, so that when startup, it will show the same partition.
- Dark mode or not
- NetID to real name. (You might want to copy this from Ionic to Neuronic)
